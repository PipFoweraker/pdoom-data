# SFF Data Source Investigation - Executive Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-30  
**Investigator**: Copilot Agent  
**Status**: Investigation Framework Complete - Awaiting Website Access  

---

## Quick Summary

Investigation completed for the Survival and Flourishing Fund (SFF) data source. Due to network access restrictions, the investigation is based on public knowledge and standard web scraping practices. A complete framework for data extraction has been prepared and is ready for implementation once website access is available.

**Recommendation**: Hybrid approach - Manual initial extraction followed by automated scraping.

## Data Fields

### Core Fields (Required)
- grant_id - Generated unique identifier
- recipient_name - Organization or individual
- amount - Grant amount in USD
- currency - ISO 4217 code (USD)
- grant_date - ISO 8601 date
- source_url - Direct link to grant

### Extended Fields (Optional)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk [OK]
- Data is publicly available
- Standard web scraping practices
- Well-documented extraction process
- Validation tools available

### Medium Risk [WARNING]
- HTML structure unknown until verified
- Possible JavaScript-rendered content
- Unknown pagination mechanism
- Rate limiting policies unknown

### Mitigation Strategies
- Respectful crawling (2s delays)
- Error handling and retries
- Manual verification of sample
- Incremental testing approach

---

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Steps

1. **Structure Validation**
   - Run `validate_dump.py` on extracted data
   - Check all required fields present
   - Verify data types correct

2. **Content Validation**
   - Spot-check 10-20 grants manually
   - Verify amounts and dates
   - Check recipient names accuracy

3. **Completeness Check**
