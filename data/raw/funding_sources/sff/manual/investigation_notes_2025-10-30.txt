SFF Data Source Investigation Notes
Date: 2025-10-30
Investigator: Copilot Agent

=== INVESTIGATION SUMMARY ===

Investigation conducted for Survival and Flourishing Fund (SFF) data source.

Source: https://survivalandflourishing.fund/

=== NETWORK ACCESS LIMITATION ===

During this investigation, direct access to the SFF website was blocked due to 
network restrictions in the sandboxed environment. The investigation report is 
based on:

1. Publicly available information about SFF
2. Typical philanthropic fund website structures
3. Existing sample data in the repository
4. Standard web scraping best practices

=== NEXT STEPS FOR FULL INVESTIGATION ===

To complete the investigation with real data:

1. Access survivalandflourishing.fund directly from an unrestricted environment
2. Navigate to grants/portfolio section
3. Identify the actual HTML structure and data layout
4. Extract 10-20 real grant records manually
5. Document the specific CSS selectors and data patterns
6. Update the extraction script with real selectors
7. Perform full automated extraction

=== WEBSITE STRUCTURE TO DOCUMENT ===

When accessing the site, document:

- Main navigation structure
- Location of grants database (URL)
- Grant listing format (table, cards, list)
- Individual grant page structure
- Pagination mechanism
- Search/filter functionality
- Any JavaScript-loaded content
- robots.txt rules
- Terms of service relevant to data extraction

=== DATA FIELDS TO EXTRACT ===

Priority fields:
- Recipient name
- Grant amount (if disclosed)
- Grant date or announcement date
- Grant type/category
- Focus area (AI safety, existential risk, etc.)
- Brief description
- Source URL (direct link to grant)

Optional fields:
- Grant ID (if provided, otherwise generate)
- Recipient type (organization vs individual)
- Detailed description
- Related links

=== EXTRACTION TOOLS ===

Recommended tools for extraction:
- requests library for HTTP requests
- BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing
- Selenium/Playwright if JavaScript rendering required
- pandas for data validation and transformation

=== RESPONSIBLE SCRAPING ===

Best practices to follow:
- Check and respect robots.txt
- Implement delays between requests (1-2 seconds)
- Use descriptive User-Agent header
- Don't overload the server
- Cache responses to avoid re-requests
- Handle errors gracefully
- Document extraction date and method

=== FILES CREATED ===

1. INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md - Comprehensive investigation documentation
2. dumps/2025-10-30_225651/ - Sample data structure demonstration
3. This file - Investigation process notes

=== SAMPLE DATA ===

Sample demonstration data created in dumps/2025-10-30_225651/:
- 3 example grants showing expected data structure
- All required fields populated
- Format follows project standards

Note: This is demonstration data, not real SFF grants.

=== READY FOR NEXT PHASE ===

The investigation framework is complete:
- Directory structure: Ready
- Data format: Defined
- Extraction process: Documented
- Sample structure: Created

Waiting on:
- Website access verification
- Real data extraction
- Script development with actual selectors
