# Survival and Flourishing Fund (SFF) - Data Source Investigation Report

**Investigation Date**: 2025-10-30  
**Investigator**: Copilot Agent  
**Source URL**: https://survivalandflourishing.fund/  
**Status**: Complete

---

## Summary

The Survival and Flourishing Fund (SFF) is a philanthropic initiative focused on reducing existential risks and improving humanity's long-term prospects. Due to network access restrictions during this investigation, this report is based on publicly available information about SFF's structure and typical grant-making patterns.

**Recommendation**: Manual extraction with web scraping potential. SFF publishes grant information publicly, but the exact format and accessibility require direct website inspection. A hybrid approach (automated scraping with manual verification) is recommended.

## Extraction Strategy

### Recommended Method: Hybrid Approach

**Phase 1: Manual Initial Extraction**
1. Navigate to SFF grants/portfolio page
2. Identify data structure and layout
3. Extract sample of 10-20 grants manually
4. Document HTML structure and selectors
5. Save to `manual/sample_YYYYMMDD.json`

**Phase 2: Automated Scraping (If Feasible)**
1. Develop web scraper using BeautifulSoup/Scrapy
2. Implement respectful crawling (delays, user-agent)
3. Extract all available grant data
4. Handle pagination and dynamic content
5. Validate extracted data
6. Save to timestamped dump directory

**Phase 3: Ongoing Maintenance**
1. Schedule quarterly re-scraping
2. Compare with previous dumps for new grants
3. Update merged dataset
4. Validate data quality

### Implementation Approach (Pseudocode)

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import json
from time import sleep

def scrape_sff_grants():
    base_url = "https://survivalandflourishing.fund"
    grants = []
    
    # Step 1: Get grants page
    response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/grants")
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    # Step 2: Find grant elements (adjust selectors)
    grant_elements = soup.find_all('div', class_='grant-item')
    
    for element in grant_elements:
        grant = {
            'grant_id': generate_id(element),
            'recipient_name': extract_recipient(element),
            'amount': extract_amount(element),
            'currency': 'USD',
            'grant_date': extract_date(element),
            'focus_area': extract_focus(element),
            'description': extract_description(element),
            'source_url': extract_url(element)
        }
        grants.append(grant)
        
        # Respectful crawling
        sleep(1)
    
    return grants

def save_to_dump(grants, source='sff'):
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S')
    dump_dir = f"data/raw/funding_sources/{source}/dumps/{timestamp}"
    os.makedirs(dump_dir, exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(f"{dump_dir}/data.json", 'w') as f:
        json.dump(grants, f, indent=2)
```

### Estimated Extraction Time

- **Manual (10 grants)**: 30-45 minutes
- **Script Development**: 2-4 hours
- **Full Automated Extraction**: 15-30 minutes (depending on total grants)
- **Validation & QA**: 30-60 minutes

### Required Dependencies

```
requests>=2.31.0
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0
lxml>=4.9.0
```

## Challenges & Limitations

### Identified Issues

1. **Network Access Restriction**
   - Unable to directly access website during investigation
   - Cannot verify current website structure
   - HTML selectors and structure unknown
   - Cannot test extraction scripts

2. **Data Quality Concerns**
   - Grant amounts may not always be publicly disclosed
   - Date precision may vary (announcement date vs grant date)
   - Recipient classification (org vs individual) may need inference
   - Description completeness varies by grant type

3. **Technical Challenges**
   - Unknown if JavaScript is required for content loading
   - Pagination structure not verified
   - No confirmation of structured data availability
   - Rate limiting policies unknown

4. **Legal/Ethical Considerations**
   - Must respect robots.txt directives
   - Implement responsible crawling practices
   - Attribution required for source data
   - Terms of service review needed

### Data Completeness

- Not all grants may be publicly announced
- Historical data may be incomplete
- Some grants may be under NDA or not disclosed
- Focus area categorization may be subjective

### Immediate Actions

1. **Verify Website Access**
   - Test direct access to survivalandflourishing.fund
   - Document actual website structure
   - Identify grant database location
   - Review robots.txt and terms of service

2. **Manual Sample Extraction**
   - Extract 10-20 real grants manually
   - Document HTML structure and selectors
   - Identify pagination mechanism
   - Save actual sample data

3. **Script Development**

   - Validate data quality
   - Compare record counts
   - Save to new timestamped dump

### Questions to Resolve

1. What is the exact structure of the SFF grants page?
2. Are there multiple pages/sections with grant information?
3. Is there a search or filter function for grants?
4. How are grants uniquely identified on the website?
5. What is the total number of grants available?
6. Are there rate limiting or anti-scraping measures?
7. Is there structured data (JSON-LD) embedded in pages?

### Ready for Implementation?

**Status**: Partial - With Caveats

**Can Proceed With**:
- Directory structure setup (complete)
- Data format standardization (complete)
- Sample data structure (complete)
- Metadata schema (complete)

**Requires Before Full Implementation**:
- Direct website access for verification
- HTML structure documentation
- Selector identification
- Extraction script development
- Real data sample extraction

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Gain website access
2. Manual exploration and documentation
3. Extract real sample (5-10 grants)
