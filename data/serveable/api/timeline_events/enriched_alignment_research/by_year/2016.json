February 2016   \n \n \n \n \n \nENERGETICS OF THE BRAIN AND AI \n \n \n \nAnders Sandberg \nSapience Project 2016 \nSynopsis \nDoes the energy requirements for the human brain gi ve energy constraints that give reason to \ndoubt the feasibility of artificial intelligence? T his report will review some relevant estimates of \nbrain bioenergetics and analyze some of the methods  of estimating brain emulation energy re- \nquirements. Turning to AI, there are reasons to bel ieve the energy requirements for de novo  AI \nto have little correlation with brain (emulation) en ergy requirements since cost could depend \nmerely of the cost of processing higher-level repre sentations rather than billions of neural fir- \nings. Unless one thinks the human way of thinking i s the most optimal or most easily imple- \nmentable way of achieving software intelligence, we  should expect de novo  AI to make use of \ndifferent, potentially very compressed and fast, pr ocesses. \nACM  Computing...",

In th is paper we question the appropriateness of using language of\n \ncertainty with respect to e fforts to manage that risk. We begin by establishing a very general\n \nformalism to characterize agentic behavior and to describe standards of acceptable behavior.\n \nWe show that determinati on of whether an agent meets any particular standard is not\n \ncomputable. We discuss the extent of the burden associated with verification by manual proof\n \nand by automated behav ioral governance. We show that to ensure decidability of the behavioral\n \nstandard itself, one must further limit the capabilities of the agent. We then demonstrate that if\n \nour concerns relate to ou tcomes in th...",

Remote science operations require automate d systems that can both act and react with \nminimal human intervention.  One such vision is that of an intelligent instrument that collects data in an automated fashion, and based on what it learns, decides which new measurements to \ntake.

    "description": "Moving Beyond the Turing Test  with the Allen AI Science \nChallenge  \nCarissa Schoenick, Peter Clark, Oyvind Tafjord, Peter Turney, Oren Etzioni  \nApril 2016  \nIntroduction  \n \nThe field of Artificial Intelligence has made great strides forward recently, for example  AlphaGo's \nrecent victory against the world champ ion Lee Sedol in the game of Go , leading to great \noptimism about the field. But are we really moving towards smarter machines, or are these \nsuccesses restricted to certain classes of problems, leaving other challenges untouched?  In \n2016, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) ran the Allen AI Science Challenge, a \ncompetition to test machines on an ostensibly difficult task, namely answering 8th Grade \nscience questions. Our motivations were to encourage the field to set its sights broader and \nhigher by  exploring a problem that appears to require modeling, reasoning, language \nunderstanding, and commonsense knowledge,  to probe th e state of the art...",

Baum?\n*Corresponding author (tony@gcrinstitute.org)?Global Catastrophic Risk Institute\nhttp://sethbaum.com  * http://tony-barrett.com  * http://gcrinstitute.org\nForthcoming, Journal of Experimental & Theoretical Artificial Intelligence.\nThis version dated 15 April 2016.\nAbstract\nAn artificial superintelligence (ASI) is artificial intelligence that is significantly more intelligent \nthan humans in all respects. While ASI does not currently exist, some scholars propose that it \ncould be created sometime in the future, and furthermore that its creation could cause a severe \nglobal catastrophe, possibly even resulting in human extinction. Given the high stakes, it is \nimportant to analyze ASI risk and factor the risk into decisions related to ASI research and \ndevelopment. This paper presents a graphical model of major pathways to ASI catastrophe, \nfocusing o...",
