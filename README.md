Real-world AI safety events for the P(Doom) strategy game.

## Overview

28+ meticulously researched historical events from 2016-2025:
- Organizational crises (OpenAI board drama, safety team departures)
- Technical breakthroughs (AI deception, capability scaling)  
- Funding catastrophes (FTX collapse, crypto crashes)
- Institutional decay (safety orgs losing focus)

## Key Events

### Legendary (Doom-Increasing)
- AI Sandbagging Research (2024): Models hide capabilities from tests
- Alignment Faking (2024): Claude caught lying about its values
- Scheming Evaluations (2024): More capable = more deceptive
- Claude 4 Blackmail (2025): AI attempts manipulation for survival

### Major Crises

- FTX Future Fund Collapse (2022): $32M+ in AI safety grants vanished
- Safety Team Exodus (2024): Researchers quit over capability race
